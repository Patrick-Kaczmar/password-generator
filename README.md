# password-generator

In this project I created a javascript file and made a function with the purpose of randomizing a password from a set of criteria chosen by the user. This password generator can provide a strong measure of security with its unbiased algorithm for character options given by the user input.

Part of the code uses inspiration from the shuffle method created by Richard Durstenfeld to randomize an array of elements.
